iSAM 1.6 (Mar 30, 2012)
- Factors now take a new Noise class instead of the square root
  information matrix; existing calls are converted by wrapping the
  matrix with the SqrtInf() constructor; additional options are
  Covariance() and Information(), which internally convert to
  square root information matrix
- added Powell's dog leg algorithm for batch (superior to
  Levenberg-Marquardt), and our novel incremental dog leg
  algorithm (see D. Rosen et al., ICRA 2012)
- better stopping criteria for batch Gauss-Newton (see
  epsilon_abs and epsilon_rel in Properties)
- added Levenberg-Marquardt option for batch optimization
- Covariance access now through Slam.covariances; cloning allows
  running covariances recovery in a separate thread
- exponential map for homogeneous points in stereo, based on Quaternions
- factors for stereo vision added (see J. McDonald et al., ECMR 2011)
- exponential map made explicit, was only implicitly used in the context
  of Euler angles so far; removed access_vector construct
- rotations internally replaced by Quaternions for improved optimization
- require() bug fixed, which removed all tests for Release mode;
  now split into require() (always active) and requireDebug() (only
  active in Debug mode, for time critical applications in inner loops)
- simplified usage of anchor nodes, see examples/achorNodes
- header file dependencies fixed (now using CMake's include_directories)
- bug fix in covariance recovery (some off-diagonal entries were incorrectly
  set to 0)
- added support for accessing arbitrary covariance entries, not just
  marginal covariances (see Slam.access_covariance() and
  examples/covariance.cpp)
- replaced Vector/Matrix classes by third party Eigen3 library (faster, and
  provides full functionality, while Vector/Matrix only provided the
  functions actively being used in iSAM)

iSAM 1.5 (Nov 12, 2010)
- code optimization, reducing execution time for the Manhattan sequence by half
- added optional CSparse-based batch factorization for comparison with CHOLMOD
- changed default properties:
  + solve in every step (instead of every 10)
  + max_iterations for batch_optimization 20 (instead of 0 = unlimited)
- added toggle (key 'c') to flip background color of 3D viewer

iSAM 1.4 (Aug 29, 2010)
- initial public release
